Facebook users have been reporting a new type of scam that tries to trick them into giving away their six digit confirmation code. This code is sent by Facebook via text message or email when someone tries to log in to your account from an unfamiliar device or browser. The scammers pretend to be Facebook support staff and ask you to verify your identity by sending them the code. If you do, they can use it to access your account and lock you out.

- Never share your six digit confirmation code with anyone, even if they claim to be from Facebook. Facebook will never ask you for this code in a message or call.
- If you receive a suspicious message or call asking for your code, ignore it and report it to Facebook. You can do this by clicking on the three dots icon in the top right corner of the message and selecting "Report Message" or "Report Conversation".
- Enable two-factor authentication on your Facebook account. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a fingerprint or a code from an app, when you log in from a new device or browser. You can set this up in your security settings.
- Use a strong and unique password for your Facebook account and change it regularly. You can also use a password manager to generate and store your passwords securely.

By following these steps, you can protect your Facebook account from hackers and scammers who try to steal your six digit confirmation code.
  
How do the scammers get your phone number or email address in the first place? They may use various methods, such as phishing, data breaches, or social engineering. Phishing is when they send you fake emails or messages that look like they are from Facebook or other trusted sources, and try to trick you into clicking on a link or downloading an attachment that contains malware or steals your information. Data breaches are when hackers break into a website or database and steal the personal information of millions of users. Social engineering is when they use psychological techniques to manipulate you into giving them your information or access to your account.
 
How can you tell if a message or call is from a scammer and not from Facebook? There are some signs that can help you spot a fake message or call. For example, the scammer may use poor grammar or spelling, ask you to click on a suspicious link or download an attachment, pressure you to act quickly or threaten you with consequences, or use a generic greeting or signature. You can also check the sender's email address or phone number and see if it matches Facebook's official contact information. If you are not sure, you can always contact Facebook directly and verify if the message or call is legitimate.
 
What should you do if you have already given your six digit confirmation code to a scammer? Don't panic, there are some steps you can take to try to recover your account. First, try to log in to your account and change your password as soon as possible. If you can't log in, go to Facebook's help center and follow the instructions on how to reset your password and secure your account. You may need to provide some proof of your identity, such as a photo of your ID or a code from a trusted device. You should also report the scammer to Facebook and warn your friends and family about the scam.
