Fortunately, there are some possible solutions that can help you fix this error and install your desired game or software. Here are some of the methods you can try:

1. **Run the installer with administrator rights.** Sometimes, the error may be caused by insufficient permissions to access or modify certain files or folders. To run the installer with administrator rights, right-click on the setup.exe file and select "Run as administrator". This will ensure that the installer has full access to the system resources.
2. **Run the installer in compatibility mode.** If you are trying to install an older game or software that was designed for a previous version of Windows, you may need to run the installer in compatibility mode. This will make the installer run as if it was on a different Windows platform, and may resolve some compatibility issues. To run the installer in compatibility mode, right-click on the setup.exe file and select "Properties". Then, go to the "Compatibility" tab and check the box for "Run this program in compatibility mode for". Choose a suitable Windows version from the drop-down menu, such as Windows 7 or Windows XP. Click "Apply" and "OK" to save the changes.
3. **Set the installer at high priority.** Another possible cause of the error is that the installer does not have enough system resources to perform the installation. To increase the priority of the installer process, you can use the Task Manager. To do this, open the Task Manager by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Esc on your keyboard. Then, go to the "Details" tab and find the setup.exe process. Right-click on it and select "Set priority". Choose "High" from the menu. This will allocate more CPU and memory resources to the installer process.
4. **Run system file and image scans.** Sometimes, the error may be caused by corrupted or missing system files that are required for the installation. To fix this, you can run two built-in tools: System File Checker (SFC) and Deployment Image Servicing Management (DISM). These tools will scan your system for any errors and repair them automatically. To run these tools, you need to open an elevated Command Prompt by right-clicking on the Start button and selecting "Command Prompt (Admin)". Then, type the following commands one by one and press Enter after each one:

sfc /scannow

dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth

Wait for each scan to finish and then restart your computer.
5. **Reregister the Isdone.dll file.** Sometimes, the error may be caused by an unregistered or outdated Isdone.dll file. To reregister this file, you need to open an elevated Command Prompt again and type this command:

regsvr32 Isdone.dll

Press Enter and wait for a confirmation message. Then, restart your computer and try installing your game or software again.
6. **Temporarily disable your antivirus software.** In some cases, your antivirus software may interfere with the installation process and cause the error. To prevent this, you can temporarily disable your antivirus software before running the installer. Make sure to re-enable it after you finish installing your game or software.

Hopefully, one of these methods will help you fix the Isarcextract Isdone.dll 64bit error on Windows and install your desired game or software without any issues. If none of these methods work, you may need to contact the game or software developer for further assistance.
