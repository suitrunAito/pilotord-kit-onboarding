The Effect is a play by Lucy Prebble, the award-winning writer of Enron and Secret Diary of a Call Girl. It explores the questions of love, sanity, neurology and medicine through the story of two young volunteers, Tristan and Connie, who agree to take part in a clinical drug trial for a new antidepressant. As they fall in love under the influence of the drug, they wonder if their feelings are real or just a side effect. Meanwhile, the doctors supervising the trial face their own ethical dilemmas and personal issues.
 
The play was first performed at the National Theatre's Cottesloe Theatre in London from November 2012 to February 2013, starring Billie Piper and Jonjo O'Neill. It received critical acclaim and won the Critics' Circle Award for Best New Play. The Guardian called it "a richly rewarding play that explores questions of sanity, neurology and the limits of medicine" [^1^]. The play was also performed off-Broadway at the Barrow Street Theatre in New York from March to September 2016, starring Susannah Flood and Carter Hudson.

The Effect is not only a love story, but also a play that tackles the complex and controversial issues of mental health, neuroscience, pharmacology and ethics. It questions the role of drugs in treating depression, the nature of free will and personal responsibility, and the validity of scientific objectivity and experimentation. The play also examines the relationships between doctors and patients, researchers and subjects, and lovers and friends.
 
The play has been praised for its witty dialogue, engaging characters, emotional impact and intellectual depth. It has also been compared to other works that explore similar themes, such as Tom Stoppard's Arcadia, Michael Frayn's Copenhagen and David Auburn's Proof. The play has been described as "a richly rewarding play that explores questions of sanity, neurology and the limits of medicine" [^1^], "a provocative and challenging play" [^2^], and "a knockout" [^3^].
 
The Effect is a play that will make you laugh, cry, think and feel. It is a play that will challenge your assumptions and stimulate your curiosity. It is a play that will stay with you long after the curtain falls.
