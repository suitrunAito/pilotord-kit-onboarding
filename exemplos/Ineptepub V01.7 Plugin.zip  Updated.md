The plugin works by finding your Adobe Digital Editions installation (on Windows and Mac OS) and creating an 'adeptkey.der' file that contains your decryption key. It then uses that file to decrypt any Adept-protected EPUBs that you add to Calibre. If you don't have Adobe Digital Editions installed on the same machine as Calibre, you will need to obtain a keyfile through other methods and put it in Calibre's configuration directory.
 
## How to use ineptepub v01.7 plugin.zip?
 
To use ineptepub v01.7 plugin.zip, you will need to have Calibre version 0.6.44 or higher installed on your computer. You can download Calibre from [here](https://calibre-ebook.com/download). You will also need to have Adobe Digital Editions installed on the same machine as Calibre, or have a keyfile generated with I <3 Cabbages' ineptkey.pyw script.
 
Here are the steps to use ineptepub v01.7 plugin.zip:
 
1. Download ineptepub v01.7 plugin.zip from [here](http://epubee.com/.../ineptepub_v01.7_plugin.zip). This file has been scanned by herdProtect and found to be clean[^1^].
2. Open Calibre and go to Preferences > Advanced > Plugins > Load plugin from file. Select the ineptepub v01.7 plugin.zip file and click Add.
3. If you have Adobe Digital Editions installed on the same machine as Calibre, the plugin will automatically find it and create an 'adeptkey.der' file in Calibre's configuration directory. If not, you will need to put your keyfile (with a '.der' extension) in that directory manually.
4. Add your Adept-protected EPUB books to Calibre by clicking Add books or dragging and dropping them into Calibre's window.
5. The plugin will automatically decrypt your EPUB books and remove the DRM. You can then convert them to other formats or send them to your devices using Calibre's features.

That's it! You have successfully used ineptepub v01.7 plugin.zip to remove DRM from your EPUB books.
 
## Troubleshooting
 
If you find that the plugin is not working for you (imported EPUBs still have DRM), you can try the following:

- Make sure you have the latest version of Calibre and ineptepub v01.7 plugin.zip.
- Make sure you have a valid keyfile in Calibre's configuration directory.
- Try adding the EPUB books to Calibre using the command line tools (calibredb add or ebook-convert).
- Check the log file (ineptepub.log) in Calibre's configuration directory for 8cf37b1e13
